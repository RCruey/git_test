    <h1>Working With Text</h1>
        <p>There are many different text elements in an HTML DOCUMENT, these are two of them. the h1 element and p element.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><h1>Heading 1</h1></li>
            <li><h2>Heading 2</h2></li>
            <li><h3>Heading 3</h3></li>
            <li><h4>Heading 4</h4></li>
            <li><h5>Heading 5</h5></li>
            <li><h6>Heading 6</h6></li>
        </ol>

        <p>It only goes <u>h1 through h6</u>, there is <strong>NO</strong> h7.</p>
        <p><em>Emphasizing</em> text and giving <strong>STRONG</strong> text has its own element as well. You could also be <b>Bold</b> or <i>italisize</i> <u>Just be sure to use appropriate tags.</u></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unordered lists are good for bullet points</li>
            <!-- I notice with HTML 5 there is a nav element now, maybe this information would come in handy for making your site work on older browsers. -->
            <li>They can also be good for nav bars as well, but thats for compatibility.</li>
        </ul>
        <dl>
            <dt>Compatibility</dt>
            <dd>
