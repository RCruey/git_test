    <!-- In the link above we added rel="noopener noreferrer"  the noopener value prvents the opened link from gaining access to the web page which it was opened. 
     The noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link or reference to it. 
     The noopener prevents phishing attacks where the opened link may chaange the original page to a different one. 
     Good practice is, if you use target="_blank", use rel="noopener noreferrer"-->
